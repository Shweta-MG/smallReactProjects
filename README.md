## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This Repo is consist of many small projects that I am completing while learning React. Mostly these projects are small and code along projects where I will be completing following some youTube tutorial or som especial course randomly found while searching for some special topic. <br> 

I will be following tutorials those are available on public platform. I will try to update ReadMe file of every project to show my gratitute to the author of the project. I will mostly using CSS directly from tutorial and will try to change logics, based on my understanding. So the final project may or may not be similiar to the tutorial I am following.
